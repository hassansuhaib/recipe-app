## This is an app where one can store Recipes and later look them up

**Note:** I am still working on this app, so this is not even the alpha version of the app

### Features of the app:
* Includes an ingredients inventory where the user can add ingredients, remove them or look them up.
* User can sort the recipes by Created, Modified or Alphabetical Order.
* On the main page, user can either look up a recipe or add a new recipe. From this page, the user can also delete the recipes or edit them.
* Compares the ingredients of a recipe with the ingredients inventory and tells if all or some of the ingredients are available.

**Working of the Edit button:**
* When user clicks the edit button, a new page opens up where the name, step and ingredients can be modified.

**Working of the Ingredients Page:**
* When the users adds or delete and ingredient, it is modified on the local storage.
